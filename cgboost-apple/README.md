# Apple Scene
Notes and lessons from [CGBoost Intro to Blender 2.8 course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3UWN2F2M2C8-zUjbFlbgtWPQa0NXBsp0).

## Getting Started
I managed to model the apple on my own! It won't win any awards, but it does look apple-like (texture notwithstanding at this point).

## Issues

1. Had problems getting Bevel modifier working as shown in the video (Part 4, ~18:00). I _believe_ it has something to do with me 
    having already applied my scale earlier but FIAK. I was seeing a bevel effect on the top of the knife but the most I could do was 
    ~2.4cm.
