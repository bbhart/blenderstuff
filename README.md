## Random notes

* Can't zoom in anymore? Turn off Perspective Mode with numpad-5.
* To "bridge" empty faces (like on the coffee cup handle):
    * Delete the opposing faces
    * Select vertices on both sides (4 on each side if square/rectangular)
    * Hit F3 and look for Bridge Edge Loops
* Use Solidify modifier in object mode to give something thickness
* Use Subdivide Surface modifier to add geometry
